# ddos-simulation_botnet
This project, ddos-simulation_botnet, is designed for educational purposes to simulate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using a network of bots managed by a central master bot. The project aims to deepen the understanding of DDoS attack mechanics and botnet behavior within a controlled environment.
